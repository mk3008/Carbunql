This C# library provides a feature to convert a selection query into an object. By objectifying, it becomes easier to modify the selection query and perform more complex manipulations such as adding join expressions. 

Using this library allows for a more versatile use of existing selection queries.

## Demo

This code adds an inner join expression to an existing select query and also adds a where condition.

No DBMS is required to run this demo ðŸ˜Š

```cs
using Carbunql;
using Carbunql.Building;
using Carbunql.Clauses;

// Convert select query to SelectQuery class.
SelectQuery sq = new SelectQuery("select s.sale_id, s.shop_id, s.sale_price from sales s");

/*
 Use the "ToCommand" method to convert the SelectQuery class to a SQL statement.

    SELECT
        s.sale_id,
        s.sale_price
    FROM
        sales AS s
 */
Console.WriteLine(sq.ToCommand().CommandText);

//Getting the From clause.
FromClause from = sq.FromClause!;

//Get the root table defined in the From clause.
SelectableTable s = from.Root;

//Inner join with "shops" master.
//The column used in the join expression is "shop_id".
SelectableTable sh = from.InnerJoin("shops").As("sh").On(s, "shop_id");

//Add column "shop_name" in "shops" master to select columns.
sq.Select(sh, "shop_name");

//Added extraction condition to where clause.
string parameterName = sq.AddParameter(":shop_id", 1);
sq.Where(sh, "shop_id").Equal(parameterName);

/*
 The result written back to the select query.

	SELECT
	    s.sale_id,
	    s.shop_id,
	    s.sale_price,
	    sh.shop_name
	FROM
	    sales AS s
	    INNER JOIN shops AS sh ON s.shop_id = sh.shop_id
	WHERE
	    sh.shop_id = :shop_id
*/
Console.WriteLine(sq.ToCommand().CommandText);

/*
 You can also get parameters from the ToCommand method.
 
 ã€€ã€€:shop_id = 1
 */
foreach (KeyValuePair<string, object?> prm in sq.ToCommand().Parameters)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"{prm.Key} = {prm.Value}");
}

/*
 If you use "Carbunql.Dapper", you can execute SQL as SelectQuery class.

 */
//var cn = IDbConnection;
//cn.Execute(sq);
```

It is also possible to convert existing queries into subqueries and CTEs.
Additionally, you can convert them to add, update, delete, and merge queries.

[Please refer to the online site for the above conversion demo](https://mk3008.github.io/Carbunql).

## Features
- DBMS agnostic
- Supports parsing select queries
- Supports processing select queries

## Constraints
- Minimum grammar check
- Only select queries can be parsed
- Comment is removed

If you want to execute modified queries, please use the [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper) library "[Carbunql.Dapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Carbunql.Dapper)".

# Getting started

> PM> Install-Package [Carbunql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Carbunql/)

The main usage is listed below. Please refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/mk3008/Carbunql/wiki) for detailed usage.

## Parse
Just pass the select query string to the constructor of the SelectQuery class.
```cs
using Carbunql;

var text = @"
select a.column_1 as col1, a.column_2 as col2
from table_a as a
left join table_b as b on a.id = b.table_a_id
where b.table_a_id is null
";

var sq = new SelectQuery(text);
string sql = sq.ToCommand().CommandText;
```

```sql
SELECT
    a.column_1 AS col1,
    a.column_2 AS col2
FROM
    table_a AS a
    LEFT JOIN table_b AS b ON a.id = b.table_a_id
WHERE
    b.table_a_id IS null
```

## Building
You can build using the SelectQuery class.
```cs
using Carbunql;
using Carbunql.Building;

var sq = new SelectQuery();

// from clause
var (from, a) = sq.From("table_a").As("a");
var b = from.InnerJoin("table_b").As("b").On(a, "table_a_id");
var c = from.LeftJoin("table_c").As("c").On(b, "table_b_id");

// select clause
sq.Select(a, "id").As("a_id");
sq.Select(b, "table_a_id").As("b_id");

// where clause
sq.Where(a, "id").Equal(":id").And(b, "is_visible").True().And(c, "table_b_id").IsNull();

// parameter
sq.Parameters.Add(":id", 1);

string sql = sq.ToCommand().CommandText;
```

```sql
/*
    :id = 1
*/
SELECT
    a.id AS a_id,
    b.table_a_id AS b_id
FROM
    table_a AS a
    INNER JOIN table_b AS b ON a.table_a_id = b.table_a_id
    LEFT JOIN table_c AS c ON b.table_b_id = c.table_b_id
WHERE
    a.id = :id
    AND b.is_visible = true
    AND c.table_b_id IS null
```

## Build subquery
```cs
using Carbunql;
using Carbunql.Building;

var sq = new SelectQuery();
sq.From(() =>
{
    var x = new SelectQuery();
    x.From("table_a").As("a");
    x.SelectAll();
    return x;
}).As("b");
sq.SelectAll();

string sql = sq.ToCommand().CommandText;
```

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            table_a AS a
    ) AS b
```

## Build condition
```cs
using Carbunql;
using Carbunql.Building;
using Carbunql.Values;

var sq = new SelectQuery();
var (from, a) = sq.From("table_a").As("a");
sq.SelectAll();

sq.Where(() =>
{
    // a.id = 1 and a.value = 2
    var c1 = new ColumnValue(a, "id").Equal(1);
    c1.And(a, "value").Equal(2));

    // a.value = 3 and a.value = 4
    var c2 = new ColumnValue(a, "id").Equal(3);
    c2.And(a, "value").Equal(4);

    // (
    //     (a.id = 1 and a.value = 2)
    //     or
    //     (a.value = 3 and a.value = 4)
    // )
    return c1.ToGroup().Or(c2.ToGroup()).ToGroup();
});

string sql = sq.ToCommand().CommandText;
```

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    table_a AS a
WHERE
    ((a.id = 1 AND a.value = 2) OR (a.id = 3 AND a.value = 4))
```

## Build exists
```cs
using Carbunql;
using Carbunql.Building;

var sq = new SelectQuery();
var (from, a) = sq.From("table_a").As("a");
sq.SelectAll();
sq.Where(() =>
{
    var x = new SelectQuery();
    var (_, b) = x.From("table_b").As("b");
    x.SelectAll();
    x.Where(b, "id").Equal(a, "id");
    return x.ToExists();
});
sq.Where(() =>
{
    var x = new SelectQuery();
    var (_, b) = x.From("table_b").As("b");
    x.SelectAll();
    x.Where(b, "id").Equal(a, "id");
    return x.ToNotExists();
});

string sql = sq.ToCommand().CommandText;
```

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    table_a AS a
WHERE
    EXISTS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            table_b AS b
        WHERE
            b.id = a.id
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            table_b AS b
        WHERE
            b.id = a.id
    )
```

## Build CTE
```cs
using Carbunql;
using Carbunql.Building;

var sq = new SelectQuery();

// a as (select * from table_a)
var ct_a = sq.With(() =>
{
    var q = new SelectQuery();
    q.From("table_a");
    q.SelectAll();
    return q;
}).As("a");

// b as (select * from table_b)
var ct_b = sq.With(() =>
{
    var q = new SelectQuery();
    q.From("table_b");
    q.SelectAll();
    return q;
}).As("b");

// select * from a iner join b a.id = b.id
var (from, a) = sq.From(ct_a).As("a");
from.InnerJoin(ct_b).On(a, "id");

sq.SelectAll();

string sql = sq.ToCommand().CommandText;
```

```sql
WITH
    a AS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            table_a
    ),
    b AS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            table_b
    )
SELECT
    *
FROM
    a
    INNER JOIN b ON a.id = b.id
```
